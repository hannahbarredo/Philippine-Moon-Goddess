                <h2>Who is Mayari?</h2>
                <p class="part1">In Tagalog mythology, Mayari ("Bulan") is the beautiful and most charming lunar deity<br>who was the daughter of Bathala, the king of the gods, to a mortal woman. She is known<br>as the most beautiful deity in Bathala's court, and only has one of her eyes.</p>

                <h2>Myths and Legends</h2>
                <p class="fightstory">In a Pampangan myth, Bathala died without leaving a will and Apolaki and Mayari fought over who would rule the earth. Apolaki wanted to rule the earth alone while Mayari insisted on equal rights. The two fought out the conflict with bamboo clubs until Mayari lost an eye. After Apolaki saw what he had done, he agreed to rule the earth together but at different times. However, her light is dimmer than her brother's due to the loss of her eye.</p>

They were said to be the daughters of Bathala by a mortal wife who died after giving birth to the three beautiful goddesses. However, in some mythology, Tala is Mayari's daughter. </p>
                <p class="right>">Mayari also have a brother named Apolaki, the god of the sun. They were all given their own attributes by their father. <br><b>(There are some variations to this. In some sources it was only Mayari, Tala and Apolaki, others it was all 3 goddesses, there's also Hanan)</b></p>
